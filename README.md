ABSTRACT

We sequenced the genome of a global collection (40 isolates) of the fungus Pyrenophora tritici-repentis (Ptr), a major foliar pathogen of wheat and model for the evolution of necrotrophic pathogens. Ptr exhibited an open-pangenome, with 43% of genes in the core set and 57% defined as accessory (present in only a subset of isolates), of which 56% were singleton genes (present in only one isolate). A clear distinction between pathogenic and non-pathogenic genomes was observed in size, gene content, and phylogenetic relatedness. Chromosomal rearrangements and structural organization, specifically around the effector coding genes, were explored further using the annotated genomes of two isolates sequenced by PacBio RS II and Illumina HiSeq. The Ptr genome exhibited major chromosomal rearrangements, including chromosomal fusion, translocation, and segment duplications. An intraspecies translocation of ToxA, the necrosis-inducing effector-coding gene, was facilitated within Ptr via a 143 kb ‘Starship’ transposon (dubbed ‘Horizon’). Additionally, ToxB, the gene encoding the chlorosis-inducing effector, was clustered as three copies on a 294 kb transposable element in a ToxB-producing isolate. ToxB and its carrying transposon were missing from the ToxB non-coding reference isolate, but the homolog
toxb and the transposon were both present in another non-coding isolate. The Ptr genome also appears to exhibit a ‘one-compartment’ organization, but may still possess a ‘two-speed genome’ that is facilitated by copy-number variation as reported in other fungal pathosystems.
