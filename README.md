ABSTRACT
We sequenced the genome of a global collection (41 isolates) of the necrotrophic fungal pathogen Pyrenophora tritic-repentis (Ptr), a major foliar wheat pathogen worldwide, and a model for the evolution of necrotrophic effectors. Ptr exhibited an open-pangenome with 43% of genes in the core set, 57% of its predicted genes defined as accessory (present in only a subset of isolates), and of those 56% are singleton genes (present in only one isolate). A clear distinction between pathogenic and non-pathogenic genomes was observed in size, gene content, and phylogenetic relationships. Some of the non-pathogenic and weakly virulent isolates had a larger genome sizes compared to the pathogenic isolates. Chromosomal rearrangements and structural organization, specifically around the effector coding genes carrying-segments, were explored further using genomes of two isolates that were sequenced by PacBio technology and previously sequenced isolates. The Ptr genome exhibited major chromosomal rearrangements, including chromosomal fusion, translocation, and segment duplications. An intraspecies translocation of ToxA, the necrosis-inducing effector coding gene, was confirmed, as ToxA and a 143 Kb crypton, was localized on two different chromosomes in the Ptr species. Additionally, ToxB, the gene encoding the chlorosis inducing effector, was clustered as three copies on a 294 Kb transposable element in the coding isolate. ToxB and its carrying transposon were missing from the ToxB non-coding reference isolate, but the homolog toxb and the transposon were present in another non-coding isolate. The  Ptr genome also exhibited a ‘one-compartment’ organization and but may still possess a ‘two-speed genome’ facilitated by copy-number variation as reported in other fungal pathosystems.
